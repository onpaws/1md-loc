Drinks<br/>6:30pm: Towards Beacon Chain Mainnet</p> <p>-----------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Presentation: Towards Beacon Chain Mainnet with Terence Tsao</p> <p>Ethereum 2.0 has been worked on for years, and has undergone innumerable iterations. It\'s a massive re-architecture of the Ethereum platform, involving new components such as proof of stake-based consensus, sharding, a WebAssembly-based VM, and more. These changes, if successful, will provide significant boosts to Ethereum\'s security, scalability, and decentralization. Prysmatic Labs is one of 8 teams building an ETH 2.0 client - the name of Prsymatic\'s client is Prysm.</p> <p>Since his talk last May, Terence will give an update on the following topics:<br/>\u2022 ETH2.0 Beacon chain spec changes<br/>\u2022 Prysm Q4/2019 accomplishments<br/>\u2022 Lessons learned from running Prysm single client testnet<br/>\u2022 Current progress on a multi-client testnet<br/>\u2022 ETH 2.0 phase 0 development<br/>\u2022 Prysm\'s 2020 roadmap</p> <p>*** This event is about the future of Ethereum as a whole, with one of its leading client engineering teams. Don\'t miss it! ***</p> <p>-----------------------------------------------------</p> <p>About the Meetup<br/>The SF Ethereum Developers Meetup has hosted Ethereum and blockchain-related events since early 2016.
